# INTERCEPTS

MISSION DIRECTIVE: An invasion force has been confirmed. We are under imminent attack. Focused signal analysis has been initiated against all intercepted communications originating from the sector where the invasion fleet was identified.

The invasion fleet has multiple types of signals encoders that they appear to be using. Our immediate concern is to crack the encoding on what has been determined to be communications between mother ships. These communications presumably will include relevant information about fleet logistics.

Your current task is to decode the most recent batch of transmissions.

## INPUT
Your input will be a series of alphanumeric characters, with one message per line.

## OUTPUT
You must output the decoded message in all capital letters, including spaces, one message per line.

## SAMPLE INPUT
89BBbBb98B8BBB8BBB88BbBBBBP9Bd889BPdB888BB8B8B8889BB8BbdBPBBdBd9BBBBBB88B8888dB88BP9                     
## SAMPLE OUTPUT
?
MISSION NOTE: We have yet to decode the current set of signals, this is your mission. Crack the cipher and then decode all messages.
