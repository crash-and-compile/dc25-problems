MISSION DIRECTIVE: Agent A-31485, we have detected anomalous signals that appear to be emanating from a nearby galactic cluster. Initial indications are that the signals may contain encoded information, potentially indicating extraterrestrial life.

As part of ongoing monitoring directives, you are tasked with validating the signals to determine whether they do in fact contain encoded data.

## INPUT
Your input will be multiple lines of spaces and * characters, indicating the strength of the signal over time. The end of each signal is indicated by a line of _ characters

## OUTPUT
You must output the decoded message in all capital letters, including spaces, one message per line.
