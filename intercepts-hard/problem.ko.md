# INTERCEPTS

MISSION DIRECTIVE: An invasion force has been confirmed. We are under imminent attack. Focused signal analysis has been initiated against all intercepted communications originating from the sector where the invasion fleet was identified.

The invasion fleet has multiple types of signals encoders that they appear to be using. Our current concern is to crack the encoding on what has been determined to be communications between fighters. These communications presumably will include relevant information about fighter formations and targets.

Your current task is to decode the most recent batch of transmissions.

## INPUT
Your input will be a series of alphanumeric characters, with one message per line.

## OUTPUT
You must output the decoded message in all capital letters, one message per line. Output messages will have no spaces.

## SAMPLE INPUT
    H L AEA AT A #N X ^ TA<>A XK A #] X ^ ANA] AZ A #T

## SAMPLE OUTPUT
    ?

MISSION NOTE: We have yet to decode the current set of signals, this is your mission. Crack the cipher and then decode all messages.
