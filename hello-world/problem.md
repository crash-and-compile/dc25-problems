# Hello World

Team &lt;Your Team Name Here&gt; is competing in the Crash and Compile contest.  Only the best
of the best programmers make it, and Team &lt;Your Team Name Here&gt; surely wants to impress.
To do that, they're going to come up with the answer to the ultimate programming challenge.
A problem so exceedingly difficuly, that it has taken some Microsoft programmers hundreds
of thousands of lines of code in order to try and compute a solution.

As Team &lt;Your Team Name Here&gt;, your task is to write a program that takes standard input,
and after careful evaluation, only sends the universal text message, the string which every
true programmer knows by heart, to standard output.

## INPUT
The input will consist of one or more lines of text.

## The Output
For each line, print the text "Hello world".


## Sample input

    Hi there!
    I like tacos.

## Sample output

    Hello world
    Hello world
